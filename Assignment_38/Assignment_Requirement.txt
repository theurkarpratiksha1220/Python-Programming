Dataset Description - Student Performance ML Dataset

The dataset student performance_ml. csv contains academic and behavioral information of students. The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a student 
will Pass (1) or Fail (0) based on various input features.
Each row in the dataset represents one student, and each column represents a measurable factor that may influence academic performance.

Features Description
	- StudyHours - Number of hours a student studies per day.
	- Attendance - Percentage of class attendance.
	- PreviousScore - Marks obtained in the previous examination.
	- AssignmentsCompleted - Number of assignments completed by the student.
	- SleepHours - Average number of hours the student sleeps per day.
	- FinalResult - Target variable (Output):
          - 1 → Pass
          - 0 → Fail

Objective of the Dataset
The goal is to:
	- Analyze how different factors affect student performance.
    - Build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a student will pass or fail.
	- Understand concepts such as training, testing, accuracy, confusion matrix, overfitting, and model evaluation.


1. Write a Python program to load the file student _performance_ml.csv using pandas.
Display:
    - First 5 records
    - Last 5 records
    - Total number of rows and columns
    - List of column names
    - Data types of each column

2. Write a program to:
    - Display total number of students in the dataset
    - Count how many students Passed (FinalResult = 1)
    - Count how many students Failed (FinalResult = 0)

3. Using pandas functions, calculate and display:
    - Average StudyHours
    - Average Attendance
    - Maximum PreviousScore
    - Minimum SleepHours

4. Use value_counts () to analyze the distribution of FinalResult.
Calculate the percentage of Pass and Fail students.
Is the dataset balanced? Justify your answer.

5. Based on the dataset values, analyze whether:
    - Higher StudyHours increase the chance of passing.
    - Higher Attendance improves FinalResult.
Write your observation in 4-5 lines.

6. Plot a histogram of StudyHours. Explain what the distribution tells you.

7. Create a scatter plot of:
    - StudyHours vs PreviousScore
Use different colors for Pass and Fail students.

8. Draw a boxplot for Attendance. Identify if any outliers are present.

9. Create a plot showing relationship between AssignmentsCompleted and FinalResult. Explain your observation.

10. Plot SleepHours against FinalResult. Does sleeping more guarantee success? Explain.
