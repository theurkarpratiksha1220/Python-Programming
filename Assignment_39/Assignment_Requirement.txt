Dataset Description - Student Performance ML Dataset

The dataset student performance_ml. csv contains academic and behavioral information of students. The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a student 
will Pass (1) or Fail (0) based on various input features.
Each row in the dataset represents one student, and each column represents a measurable factor that may influence academic performance.

Features Description
	- StudyHours - Number of hours a student studies per day.
	- Attendance - Percentage of class attendance.
	- PreviousScore - Marks obtained in the previous examination.
	- AssignmentsCompleted - Number of assignments completed by the student.
	- SleepHours - Average number of hours the student sleeps per day.
	- FinalResult - Target variable (Output):
          - 1 → Pass
          - 0 → Fail

Objective of the Dataset
The goal is to:
	- Analyze how different factors affect student performance.
    - Build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a student will pass or fail.
	- Understand concepts such as training, testing, accuracy, confusion matrix, overfitting, and model evaluation.


1. Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn. Create a model object and train it using fit ().

2. Use the trained model to predict results for X_test. Display predicted values along with actual values.

3. Calculate model accuracy using accuracy_score. Display the result in percentage format.

4. Generate confusion matrix using sklearn. Display it using ConfusionMatrixDisplay. Explain clearly:
    - True Positive
    - True Negative
    - False Positive
    - False Negative

5. Calculate:
    - Training accuracy
    - Testing accuracy
Compare both and comment whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.

6. Train three Decision Tree models with:
    - max_depth = 1
    - max_depth = 3
    - max_depth = None
Compare their testing accuracies and write your observations.

7. Use the trained model to predict result for a student with:
    - StudyHours = 6
    - Attendance = 85
    - PreviousScore = 66
    - AssignmentsCompleted = 7
    - SleepHours = 7
Will the student Pass or Fail?

8. Write a single structured Python program that performs:
    1. Dataset loading
	2. Data analysis
	3. Visualization
	4. Train-test split
	5. Model training
    6. Prediction
	7. Accuracy calculation
	8. Confusion matrix generation
	9. Final conclusion
Your code should include proper comments explaining each step.
