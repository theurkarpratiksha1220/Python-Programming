Dataset Description - Student Performance ML Dataset

The dataset student performance_ml. csv contains academic and behavioral information of students. The objective of this dataset is to predict whether a student 
will Pass (1) or Fail (0) based on various input features.
Each row in the dataset represents one student, and each column represents a measurable factor that may influence academic performance.

Features Description
	- StudyHours - Number of hours a student studies per day.
	- Attendance - Percentage of class attendance.
	- PreviousScore - Marks obtained in the previous examination.
	- AssignmentsCompleted - Number of assignments completed by the student.
	- SleepHours - Average number of hours the student sleeps per day.
	- FinalResult - Target variable (Output):
          - 1 → Pass
          - 0 → Fail

Objective of the Dataset
The goal is to:
	- Analyze how different factors affect student performance.
    - Build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a student will pass or fail.
	- Understand concepts such as training, testing, accuracy, confusion matrix, overfitting, and model evaluation.



1. After training the Decision Tree model, use:
model. feature_importances_
    - Display importance score of each feature.
    - Which feature contributes the most in predicting FinalResult?
    - Which feature contributes the least?

2. Remove the column SleepHours from the dataset.
    - Train the model again.
    - Compare new accuracy with previous accuracy.
    - Does removing this feature affect performance?

3. Train the model using only:
    - StudyHours
    - Attendance
Compare the accuracy with the full-feature model. Is the model still performing well?

4. Create a new DataFrame with details of 5 new students.Use the trained model to predict their results.
Display predictions clearly.

5. Without using accuracy_score, manually calculate accuracy:
Verify whether it matches sklearn accuracy.

6. Identify students where:
Y_test != Y_pred
Display those rows.
How many students were misclassified?
What common pattern do you observe?

7. Train model using:
	- random_state = 0
	- random state = 10
	- random_state = 42
compare testing accuracy. Does the results change?

8. Decision Tree Visualization
Use:
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
Visualize the trained decision tree.
	- Which feature appears at the root node?
	- Why do you think that feature was selected first?

9. Create a new column:
PerformanceIndex = (StudyHours * 2) + Attendance
Train the model including this new feature.
Does accuracy improve?

10. Train model with:
    - max_depth = None
Calculate:
    - Training accuracy
    - Testing accuracy
If training accuracy is 100% but testing accuracy is lower, explain why this happens.
